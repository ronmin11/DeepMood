# DeepMood
This novel implementation aims to address the lack of empathy and emotional awareness in everyday interactions. When individuals struggle to recognize or understand others' emotions, it can contribute to feelings of isolation, loneliness, or depression in those who go unnoticed or misunderstood. A potential remedy of this issue would be to utilize machine-learning based emotion classifiers with CNN architectures and fully connected layers to efficiently and effectively determine the mood of anyone given an image of their face. This could develop to more practical uses such as in real-world hospitals for improved psychological therapy diagnosis.

# Info
Emotion Detection & Classification task using multiple Machine Learning algorithms, such as CNN's, k-means clustering, naive bayes, SVM's, as well as utilizing many pretrained architectures including Resnet50, VGG19, and more. It also presents a novel combination of all of these as well as a chatbot tailored to your specific needs. This is meant to be able to provide simulated theraptic suggestions, and is NOT meant to serve as an actual therapist. One should always consult a verified professional therapist to obtain the most reliable feedback.
