# DeepMood
This novel implementation aims to address the lack of empathy and emotional awareness in everyday interactions. When individuals struggle to recognize or understand others' emotions, it can contribute to feelings of isolation, loneliness, or depression in those who go unnoticed or misunderstood. A potential remedy of this issue would be to utilize machine-learning based emotion classifiers with CNN architectures and fully connected layers to efficiently and effectively determine the mood of anyone given an image of their face. This could develop to more practical uses such as in real-world hospitals for improved psychological therapy diagnosis.
